# Summary: Chain Added Successfully! ✅

## What We Just Did

Successfully added **Moonbase Alpha** as a supported destination chain for AssetHubVault!

```
Chain ID: 1287
Chain Name: Moonbase Alpha
XCM Destination: 0x01010000000507  
Executor: 0xf7749B6A5aD0EB4ed059620B89f14FA8e916ee41 (Your XCMProxy)
Status: ✅ Active
```

## Next Steps

The investment dispatch tests are failing because the function signature is different than expected. Here's what needs to be done:

### Actual `dispatchInvestment` Function Signature:

```solidity
function dispatchInvestment(
    address user,                    // User making the investment
    uint32 chainId,                  // Destination chain (1287 for Moonbase)
    address poolId,                  // Target pool address on Moonbase
    address baseAsset,               // Base asset (e.g., WETH) 
    uint256 amount,                  // Amount to invest
    int24 lowerRangePercent,         // Lower price range (-500 to 500)
    int24 upperRangePercent,         // Upper price range (-500 to 500)
    bytes calldata destination,      // XCM destination encoding
    bytes calldata preBuiltXcmMessage // Pre-built XCM message
) external onlyOperator whenNotPaused
```

### What You Need to Test:

1. **Prepare Test Data:**
   - User address (must have deposited balance)
   - Moonbase pool address (real or mock)
   - Base asset address (WETH on Moonbase: `0x1436aE0dF0A8663F18c0Ec51d7e2E46591730715`)
   - Amount to invest
   - Price range (e.g., -50 to +50 for 50% range)
   - XCM destination bytes
   - Pre-built XCM message bytes

2. **Required Setup:**
   - ✅ Chain added (Done!)
   - ⚠️  XCM Precompile must be set (currently `0x000...000`)
   - ✅ Test mode enabled (XCM will be skipped)
   - User must have deposited balance

## The XCM Precompile Issue

Your contract checks:
```solidity
if (XCM_PRECOMPILE == address(0)) revert XcmPrecompileNotSet();
```

Even in test mode, it requires the XCM precompile address to be set. You need to:

### Set the XCM Precompile Address:

The XCM precompile on Paseo Asset Hub is typically at:
```
0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000816
```

Call as admin:
```javascript
await vault.setXCMPrecompile("0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000816");
```

## Quick Test Without XCM

If you want to test the flow without dealing with XCM encoding:

1. **Set XCM Precompile:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/set-xcm-precompile.js --network passethub
   ```

2. **Deposit funds as user:**
   ```javascript
   await vault.deposit({ value: ethers.parseEther("1") });
   ```

3. **Dispatch investment (as operator):**
   ```javascript
   await vault.dispatchInvestment(
     userAddress,
     1287,                      // Moonbase chainId
     poolAddress,               // Pool on Moonbase
     wethAddress,               // WETH
     ethers.parseEther("0.5"),  // Amount
     -50,                       // Lower range
     50,                        // Upper range
     "0x01010000000507",        // XCM destination (from chain config)
     "0x"                       // Empty XCM message (test mode skips it)
   );
   ```

## What Test Mode Does

With `testMode = true`:
- XCM message building is skipped
- XCM send is skipped
- Position is still created
- Balance is still deducted
- Events are still emitted

Perfect for testing the core logic without XCM complexity!

## Action Items

### Immediate (to run tests):
1. [ ] Set XCM precompile address
2. [ ] Update test file with correct parameters
3. [ ] Ensure test user has deposited balance

### For Production:
1. [ ] Build proper XCM messages
2. [ ] Test XCM delivery end-to-end
3. [ ] Disable test mode
4. [ ] Monitor XCM success/failure events

## Files Created:

- ✅ `scripts/add-moonbase-chain.js` - Add chain configuration
- ✅ `ADD_CHAIN_GUIDE.md` - Chain configuration guide
- ⏳ `test/AssetHubVault/testnet/3.investment.test.js` - Needs parameter fixes

Would you like me to:
1. Create a script to set the XCM precompile?
2. Fix the investment test with correct parameters?
3. Create a simple manual test script for dispatch?
