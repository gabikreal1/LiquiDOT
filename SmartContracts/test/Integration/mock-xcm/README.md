# Mock XCM Integration Tests

## 🎯 Purpose

These tests verify **complete integration logic** between AssetHubVault and XCMProxy **WITHOUT requiring real XCM infrastructure**. 

Instead of waiting for XCM channels, we:
1. Deploy both contracts on the **same network** (local or testnet)
2. **Manually call** the functions that XCM would trigger
3. **Manually relay** state between contracts

This lets you test the integration **NOW** before XCM is ready!

## 🔄 How It Works

### Traditional XCM Flow (Requires XCM Channel)
```
AssetHub                              Moonbase
---------                             --------
dispatchInvestment() 
    ↓
    📡 XCM Message →
                                      ← XCM arrives
                                      executeInvestment()
                                      (creates position)
                                      
                                      liquidatePosition()
                                      ↓
    ← XCM Return
settleLiquidation()
(updates balance)
```

### Mock XCM Flow (Same Network)
```
AssetHubVault                         XCMProxy
-------------                         --------
dispatchInvestment()
    ↓
    💸 Manual fund transfer →
    📞 Manual call →
                                      executeInvestment()
                                      (creates position)
                                      
                                      liquidatePosition()
                                      ↓
    ← Manual fund transfer
    ← Manual call
settleLiquidation()
(updates balance)
```

## 📋 Test Files

### 1. Investment Flow (`1.mock-investment-flow.test.js`)
Tests complete investment creation:
- ✅ User deposits to AssetHubVault
- ✅ Operator dispatches investment (test mode - no real XCM)
- ✅ **Manually fund** XCMProxy (simulates XCM asset transfer)
- ✅ **Manually call** `executeInvestment` (simulates XCM message)
- ✅ Verify position created on both contracts

  Complete Mock XCM Investment Flow
    📥 STEP 1: User deposits to AssetHubVault
       ✓ Deposited 10.0 ETH
       ✓ User balance: 10.0 ETH

    🚀 STEP 2: Operator dispatches investment (test mode - no XCM)
       ✓ Investment dispatched, positionId: 0x...
       ✓ User balance reduced to: 5.0 ETH

    🌉 STEP 3: SIMULATE XCM MESSAGE (manual call to XCMProxy)
       (In production, this would be triggered by XCM message arrival)
       ✓ Funded XCMProxy with 5.0 ETH (simulating XCM transfer)
       ✓ XCMProxy.executeInvestment called (simulated XCM message)

    ✅ STEP 4: Verify position created on Moonbase (XCMProxy)
       ✓ Position active: true
       ✓ Position user: 0x...
       ✓ NFT tokenId: 1

    ✅ STEP 5: Verify position tracked on Asset Hub (AssetHubVault)
       ✓ Position active: true
       ✓ Position amount: 5.0 ETH
       ✓ Position chainId: 1287

    ✅ STEP 6: Verify user positions arrays
       ✓ AssetHubVault: User has 1 position(s)
       ✓ XCMProxy: User has 1 position(s)

    🎉 INTEGRATION TEST PASSED!
       Both contracts successfully coordinated without real XCM!

    ✓ should complete investment flow without real XCM (2340ms)
    ✓ should handle multiple positions (1876ms)
    ✓ should validate parameters on both sides (423ms)
    ✓ should emit correct events on both contracts (1234ms)

  State Consistency
    ✓ should maintain consistent state across both contracts (987ms)

  5 passing (8s)
```

## 💡 Key Differences from Real XCM Tests

| Aspect | Real XCM Tests | Mock XCM Tests |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **Network** | Asset Hub + Moonbase | Same network (local/testnet) |
| **XCM Channel** | Required | Not needed |
| **Asset Transfer** | Via XCM | Manual `sendTransaction` |
| **Message Trigger** | XCM arrival | Manual function call |
| **Test Speed** | Slow (30-60s XCM) | Fast (local blocks) |
| **When to Run** | After XCM ready | **NOW** |
| **What it Tests** | Full stack + XCM | Integration logic only |

## 🔧 Technical Details

### How We Simulate XCM Asset Transfer
```javascript
// Real XCM would transfer assets cross-chain
// We manually send funds to simulate this:
await deployer.sendTransaction({
  to: xcmProxyAddress,
  value: investmentAmount
});
```

### How We Simulate XCM Message
```javascript
// Real XCM would trigger this via precompile
// We manually call the function:
await xcmProxy.executeInvestment(
  user,
  pool,
  asset,
  amount,
  lowerRange,
  upperRange,
  positionId
);
```

### Test Mode Requirement
Both contracts must have `testMode = true` to skip real XCM precompile calls:
```javascript
await assetHubVault.setTestMode(true);
await xcmProxy.setTestMode(true);
```

## 🎯 When to Use Each Test Type

### Use Mock XCM Tests (These) When:
- ✅ Testing integration logic NOW
- ✅ Developing locally
- ✅ XCM not yet available
- ✅ Fast iteration needed
- ✅ Debugging contract interactions

### Use Real XCM Tests When:
- ⏳ XCM channel is established
- ⏳ Testing actual cross-chain messaging
- ⏳ Validating XCM message encoding
- ⏳ Testing in production-like environment
- ⏳ Final integration validation

## 📈 Benefits

1. **Test Now, Deploy Later**
   - Don't wait for XCM infrastructure
   - Validate logic immediately
   
2. **Fast Development Cycle**
   - No 30-60s XCM wait times
   - Instant feedback
   
3. **Complete Coverage**
   - Tests ALL integration logic
   - Just not the XCM transport layer
   
4. **Easy Debugging**
   - Single network = easier tracing
   - Standard Hardhat debugging tools
   
5. **Cost Effective**
   - No testnet XCM fees
   - Free local testing

## 🚨 Limitations

These tests do NOT cover:
- ❌ XCM message encoding/decoding
- ❌ Cross-chain delivery timing
- ❌ XCM fees and weight
- ❌ Network latency
- ❌ XCM error handling

For full validation, you'll still need real XCM tests once the channel is ready!

## 🎓 Summary

**Mock XCM Integration Tests = Integration Logic Testing WITHOUT XCM**

You get:
- ✅ Full integration test coverage NOW
- ✅ Fast feedback loop
- ✅ Confidence in contract logic
- ✅ Ready to switch to real XCM when available

Perfect for:
- 🔧 Development phase (NOW)
- 🧪 Pre-XCM validation
- 🏃 Fast iteration

Complement with real XCM tests when ready for production!

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Now:** Run mock XCM tests
   ```bash
   npm run test:integration:mock
   ```

2. **Verify:** All integration logic works
   
3. **Later:** When XCM ready, run real tests
   ```bash
   npm run test:integration:real
   ```

4. **Deploy:** With confidence in both logic AND transport!
