## 🚀 How to Use What We Created

### Step 1: Install Foundry

Follow the guide in `FOUNDRY_INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md`:

**Windows (using Git Bash):**
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

**Or download binaries from:**
https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/releases

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd SmartContracts
forge install foundry-rs/forge-std --no-commit
```

### Step 3: Build Contracts

```bash
forge build
```

### Step 4: Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
forge test

# Run with verbosity
forge test -vv

# Run specific test file
forge test --match-path test/foundry/AssetHubVault.t.sol

# Run with gas report
forge test --gas-report

# Generate coverage
forge coverage
```
