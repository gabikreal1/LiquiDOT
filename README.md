## LiquiDOT ðŸŒŠ

Cross-chain liquidity automation for the Polkadot ecosystem. Built on Asset Hub for custody and using XCM for execution across parachains, LiquiDOT lets users deposit into a vault, define LP strategy, and earn fees without manual rebalancing.

### Current status

- Ongoing development; MVP targeting Moonbeam Algebra pools with Asset Hub custody and an XCM Proxy on Moonbeam.
- Contracts are deployed on testnet, currently bringing the backend to production grade.
- Have been approved a grant application to support development: see Polkadot Fast Grants PR [#86](https://github.com/Polkadot-Fast-Grants/apply/pull/86).

### Documentation

### White paper

- See `WhitePaper.md` in this repo for full architecture and scope.
- Quick excerpt: LiquiDOT follows a hub-and-spoke model with an Asset Hub Vault for custody/orchestration and a Moonbeam XCM Proxy for DEX execution. Users select asymmetric percentage ranges (e.g., -5%/+10%); contracts convert these to precise tick ranges and automate mint/burn, rebalancing, and stop-loss actions across chains.

### What LiquiDOT delivers

- Automated LP position management across parachains via XCM
- Asymmetric range selection with automatic tick conversion
- Stop-loss/take-profit style liquidations returned back to Asset Hub
- Data-driven decision engine (backend) aligned with user preferences

### Deployment & Testing Workflow

1. Deploy AssetHubVault on Paseo via Remix and set `$env:ASSETHUB_CONTRACT`. Then bootstrap Moonbase with:
	- `npx hardhat run SmartContracts/scripts/deploy-moonbase.js --network moonbase`
	- This deploys Algebra, XCMProxy (test mode enabled), two test tokens, and creates/initializes a pool.
	- It writes `SmartContracts/deployments/moonbase_bootstrap.json` that tests auto-read.
2. Wire and verify using helpers in `SmartContracts/test/helpers/`:
	- Link contracts: `link-contracts.js` on `passethub` then `moonbase`
	- Enable test mode on Asset Hub: `enable-test-mode.js` on `passethub`
	- Optional liquidity: `provide-liquidity.js` on `moonbase` (uses bootstrap addresses)
	- Verify config: `verify-xcmproxy-config.js` on `moonbase`
3. Run tests from `SmartContracts/test` (examples in `.test-commands.md`), including XCMProxy, AssetHubVault, and integration flows.


All required deployment, wiring, and verification helpers ship with the repositoryâ€”no additional scripts are needed beyond configuring the expected environment variables.
