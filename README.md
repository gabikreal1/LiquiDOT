## LiquiDOT ðŸŒŠ

Cross-chain liquidity automation for the Polkadot ecosystem. Built on Asset Hub for custody and using XCM for execution across parachains, LiquiDOT lets users deposit into a vault, define LP strategy, and earn fees without manual rebalancing.

### Current status

- Ongoing development; MVP targeting Moonbeam Algebra pools with Asset Hub custody and an XCM Proxy on Moonbeam.
- Prototype contracts and frontend are in this repo; cross-chain wiring and production hardening are in progress.
- Have been approved a grant application to support development: see Polkadot Fast Grants PR [#86](https://github.com/Polkadot-Fast-Grants/apply/pull/86).

### Documentation

[Our official documentation] (https://liquidot.gitbook.io/liquidot-docs)

### White paper

- See `WhitePaper.md` in this repo for full architecture and scope.
- Quick excerpt: LiquiDOT follows a hub-and-spoke model with an Asset Hub Vault for custody/orchestration and a Moonbeam XCM Proxy for DEX execution. Users select asymmetric percentage ranges (e.g., -5%/+10%); contracts convert these to precise tick ranges and automate mint/burn, rebalancing, and stop-loss actions across chains.

### What LiquiDOT delivers

- Automated LP position management across parachains via XCM
- Asymmetric range selection with automatic tick conversion
- Stop-loss/take-profit style liquidations returned back to Asset Hub
- Data-driven decision engine (backend) aligned with user preferences
