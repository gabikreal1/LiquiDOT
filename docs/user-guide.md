- If the tokens in your pool increase in value
- Not guaranteed - tokens can also decrease

- Your LP tokens might be worth less than holding the original tokens
- LiquiDOT's range management helps minimize this risk

- All DeFi protocols carry technical risks
- LiquiDOT uses audited, battle-tested contracts
- Always invest only what you can afford to lose

#### **Market Risk**
