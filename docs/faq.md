- **Cross-Chain Native**: Built specifically for Polkadot's multi-chain architecture
- **Asymmetric Ranges**: Set different upside/downside limits (e.g., -5%/+10%)
- **User-Friendly Risk Management**: Percentage-based controls instead of complex tick values
- **Automated Stop-Loss**: Automatic position closure when price moves against you
- **Hub-and-Spoke Security**: Custody separated from execution for maximum security

### Is LiquiDOT safe to use?

**Security Measures:**
- ‚úÖ **OpenZeppelin** battle-tested contracts
- ‚úÖ **Separation of concerns** - custody isolated from execution
- ‚úÖ **Emergency controls** for crisis management
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive testing** with 100% coverage
- ‚úÖ **Multi-signature** admin controls
- ‚è≥ **Third-party audits** (planned for Q2 2025)

**Risks to Consider:**
- Smart contract risk (inherent to all DeFi)
- Impermanent loss from LP positions
- Market volatility and liquidation risk

## üéØ Strategy & Risk Management

### What's the difference between Conservative, Moderate, and Aggressive strategies?

| Strategy | Range | Rebalancing | Risk Level | Best For |
|----------|-------|-------------|------------|----------|
| **Conservative** | -2% to +3% | Frequent | Low | Risk-averse users, beginners |
| **Moderate** | -5% to +8% | Balanced | Medium | Most users, balanced approach |
| **Aggressive** | -10% to +15% | Infrequent | High | Experienced users, higher risk tolerance |
| **Custom** | You decide | You control | Variable | Advanced users wanting full control |

### How does stop-loss work?

**Automatic Protection:**
1. **Range Monitoring**: System continuously monitors your position's price range
2. **Exit Trigger**: When price moves outside your set range (e.g., -5% to +10%)
3. **Liquidation**: Position is automatically closed and converted back to your base asset
4. **Asset Return**: Proceeds are returned to your Asset Hub balance

**Example:**
- You set a range of -5% to +10% around current DOT price
- DOT price drops 6% ‚Üí Position automatically liquidated
- Proceeds converted to USDC and returned to your account

### What is impermanent loss and how does LiquiDOT help?

**Impermanent Loss Explained:**
- Occurs when token prices in your LP position diverge significantly
- Your LP tokens might be worth less than just holding the original tokens
- **Example**: You LP USDC/DOT, DOT pumps 100% ‚Üí you have less DOT than if you just held

**How LiquiDOT Helps:**
- **Range Management**: Positions exit before extreme price movements
- **Stop-Loss Protection**: Limits downside exposure
- **Automatic Rebalancing**: Adjusts positions as market conditions change
- **Diversification**: Spreads risk across multiple pools and strategies
