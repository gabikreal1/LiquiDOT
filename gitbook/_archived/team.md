## Our Motivation

We came together around a shared interest in solving a problem we've encountered ourselves: **the lack of smart, automated tools for liquidity providers.**

### The Problem We Saw
While trading platforms have long supported automation, stop-loss, and take-profit features, these tools haven't made their way into LP management. As active participants in DeFi, we experienced firsthand:

* Manual position monitoring is time-consuming
* Missing liquidation triggers leads to losses
* Managing liquidity across chains is fragmented
* No user-friendly tools for asymmetric range management
* Lack of automated risk management

### Our Vision
We wanted to build something that gives users more control and peace of mind when providing liquidity. With our combined backgrounds in:

* **Fintech** (Rashad's experience at Checkout.com)
* **Web3 Development** (Gabriel's hackathon wins and DeFi projects)
* **DeFi Analytics** (Fedir's hands-on LP experience)

...we had the right mix of skills to bring the idea to life ‚Äî and it's something we're genuinely excited to use ourselves.

## Working Philosophy
